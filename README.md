Binary Search Tree assignment from: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/binary-search-trees

Built Node and Tree classes. Nodes store data and l/r children. Tree has many methods including build_tree, insert, delete, find, level_order, inorder, preorder, postorder, height, depth, balanced? and rebalance.

Learning outcomes included loads of practice using recursion and understanding this common data structure. This project took a fair amount of time, but was honestly more fun than I had anticipated.

One thing I might toy with is Tree class is too long for rubocop check. I'm not sure how to go about solving this just now, so I'm fine with leaving as is for the moment.
